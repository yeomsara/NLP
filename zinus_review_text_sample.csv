R2J09R8P7X5IKF,the United States,Beds,B077P6RSZ3,2021-06-28,1,CHEAP AND STRUCTURALLY AWFUL," this bed frame and headboard ""look"" nice...but what's hiding underneath is absolutely horrible....""particle board""...the cheapest most structurally unstable material that could have been used. this bed didn't even last a couple of months...there is some actual wood framing in the headboard and footboard, however the side rails of the bed are total trash. they come in two smaller pieces (likely to keep shipping size down) but the ""wood"" underneath the upholstery for the side rails is trash...because it is particle board. the side rails ""hook in"" to the bolts on the head and footboard for support, however the metal bracket that is affixed to the side rails to do so is screwed in to particle board...meaning the entire weight bearing portion of the frame along the edges of the bed is held in by four 1/2inch screws into..particle board. with the weight of a king size mattress along with any normal sized humans...this will not last and is just cheap construction with cheap materials. additionally, since the side rails are not one solid piece of wood, you have to attach a wood foot in the middle of the bed rail on the back side to hold them together. again this makes it structurally poor, but also the foot is black and located just under the edge of the bed. my wife and i proceeded to stub our toe or hit our foot just about every time we walked up to the bed to lay down. both of these ""legs"" cracked in the middle within days of assembling the bed as again, this is not a well constructed material/engineering. i just spent the morning pulling the whole bed apart since it broke again where the particle board gave way and re-upholdtering the side rails with actual wood that is structurally sound. while the price is decent - you 100% get what you pay for...a cheap bed with awful selection of actual materials used hiding underneath a decent looking upholstered headboard and footboard. would not recommend this product due to the cheap materials used. you will either waste the day like i did or the 3 evenings i spent trying to ""fix"" the issues...or just get pissed enough to throw it out and go buy a real wood frame. luckily my wife is the voice of reason and hopefully this replacement of particle board with actual wood will be the fix...othwise to the curb it goes.
